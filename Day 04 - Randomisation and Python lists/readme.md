# Notes:

- Randomisation adds some unpredictiveness to the program.
- Fun Fact: Python Uses `Mersenne Twister` to generate randomness.

### We create random numbers in python using the `random module`

To use `random, function` youâ€™ll need to import the module.

```python
import random 

random_number = random.randint(1,10)

print(random_numer)       # Prints a random output from 1-9.

```

## Lists:

- Lists is a type of data structure used in order to store data

data structure:

```python
fruits = ["Apple", "Banana" , "Mango"]

# If you are looking to add any additional fruit to the list, it can be done using append function.

fruits.append("Pineapple")

# Now the fruits list value is:

fruits = ["Apple", "Banana" , "Mango", "Pineapple"]

```

Nested lists: If we have a list inside a list, it is called a nested lists.
